# Learning more

The DCL curriculum covers the basics of data science in R, but there's still a lot to learn! To keep learning, it's good to build up a regular practice to keep up to date. Here are some useful resources:

-   [tidyverse.org](http://tidyverse.org): An up-to-date resource for everything tidyverse.

    -   [tidyverse.org blog](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/): Articles and descriptions of new package releases.

-   [R Weekly](https://rweekly.org): A weekly newsletter highlighting what's been happening in the R community.
